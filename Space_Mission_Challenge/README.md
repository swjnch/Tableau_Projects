### Space Missions Launch Analysis

The project is done as part of the Maven Space Challenge hosted by @MavenAnalytics. The data used here contains information related to space mission launches starting from 1957 to 2022. I have used Python and Tableau for data exploration, manipulation, and analysis.  Based on the information from google few of the launch sites are assigned to their respective countries for ease of analysis:

Gran Canaria: Spain

Barents Sea: Russia

New Mexico: USA

Shahrud Missile Test Site: Iran

Yellow Sea: China

Pacific Missile Range Facility: USA

Pacific Ocean: Kiribati

Price values with missing data were filtered for evaluating the average prices. All the failure categories (Failure, Partial Failure, Prelaunch Failure) 
were grouped to analyze the bar chart for success vs failure over the decades.

There were a total of 4,630 missions that occurred between 1957 to 2022. 

Only 21% of the rockets are active out of the 370 rockets used for launching. 

The USA and Russia followed by Kazakhstan have had the most launches over the decades.

The decades 70s and 2010s have contributed to the majority of launches and 
successful missions. The average price of the rockets had significantly declined over the years, as private launch providers have created a competitive 
market that reduced the prices of the trip to space.

Delta IV Heavy owned by the USA is the most expensive rocket that is active.
